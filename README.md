# US-Crime-Analysis
The purpose of our project is to provide a distinct and clear perspective on crimes that have taken place in the US by providing an interactive visualization of solved crimes in different regions. The research intends to collect and clean crime data from numerous sources before analyzing the data to identify patterns and trends in crime rates across various states, cities, and neighborhoods.
The ultimate purpose of this project is to produce interactive dashboards and maps that allow users to explore data and spot patterns and trends using data visualization tools such as Tableau. This interactive dashboard can be used by government agencies and individuals to assess various agencies that have successfully solved crimes in various regions and how safe the neighborhood is. Different authorities can utilize this to observe patterns between different sorts of crimes and the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator.
